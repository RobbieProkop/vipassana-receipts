<h1>APP STILL IN PROGRESS!</h1>

<h1>Alberta Vipassana Foundation tax receipt app</h1>

This is a single-page react app created for the Alberta Vipassana Foundatoin. This project was created 100% by Robbie Prokop.

This repository is built using React, SCSS, Axios, Redux, React-Dom, React-Router-Dom, and React-Toastify in the front end. For the backend I used NodeJS, ExpressJS, MOngoDB, and mongoose. I tried to make the code fairly modularized and use current industry "best practices" as I understand them. A big stretch goal of mine is to eventually get 80% + test coverage.
